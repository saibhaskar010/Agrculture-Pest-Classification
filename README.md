# 🌾 Agricultural Pests Classification using Deep Learning

Welcome to the Agricultural Pests Classification project! This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to classify different agricultural pests using deep convolutional neural networks and transfer learning techniques.

## 👋 Introduction

This project utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to build and train models that can identify various pests from images. By leveraging advanced deep learning techniques such as transfer learning, data augmentation, and hyperparameter tuning, the models aim to achieve high accuracy, facilitating early pest detection in agriculture which is crucial for crop management and protection.

## 🔬 Overview

Pest image classification is becoming increasingly relevant in the context of sustainable agriculture. This technology helps in reducing the use of chemical pesticides, lowering labor costs, and enhancing crop management through early detection of pests.

## 🚀 Features

- Use of TensorFlow and Keras for model building.
- Implementation of convolutional neural networks with custom layers and residual blocks.
- Application of transfer learning using MobileNetV3 and EfficientNet models.
- Data augmentation to improve model robustness.
- Hyperparameter tuning with Keras Tuner.
- Evaluation of models based on accuracy and loss metrics.
